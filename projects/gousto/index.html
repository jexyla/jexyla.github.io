  <h2>The challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Gousto delivers everything food lovers need to cook the recipes they love, weekly. It delivers quality ingredients, in exact portions; with step-by-step recipe cards that make cooking simple and enjoyable.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I joined Gousto, I was the only designer and the whole team was made up of 20 people. But while the company was experiencing growth quickly, the brand was struggling to keep up with the change and we felt like a re-branding was very much needed.
    The company needed a rebranding that translates better the core values and the funny and exciting overall experience.
  </p>

  <h2>The approach</h2>
  <p>
    The Gousto name is a composition of the Italian word “gusto” (meaning flavor) and the foodie loving word “gourmet”. The main key values that the logo should have been reflecting were: delicious, quality, simple and stressless. Based on these key values
    I started sketching out some concepts for the new logo.

    All of the concepts were trying to highlight the cooking experience and from there there was the inspirationg of using the pot as a symbol. The final logo plays with the central ‘u’, converting it into a pot. It has a humorous feel, reflects savouring
    and a cooking experience reinforcing our good looks and warm vibes at every customer touch point. They de ne an appropriate tone and style, and re ect Gousto’s core values; outlining a distinctive and enduring personality.

    The icons are based on handrawn drawings that support and enhance design elements and reinforce the playful and quirky aspects of Gousto’s personality. The choice of handrawn icons was to make the brand feeling more friendly and accessible, thus giving
    an immediately recognizable and unique style which competitors were lacking.

  <h2>Marketing</h2>
  <p>
    Since launching the new logo and brand identity, Gousto registered an increase in customers engagement which can be easily spotted on social media. From only 500 followers on Twitter, Gousto reached 10,000 in a few months, all thanks to the new quirky
    pakaging that resulted appealing to people for its warmth & personality; making them want to engage with the brand and share their experience via social media.

  <h2>Website</h2>
  <p>
    This is a design I did a wile ago for Gousto to improve the current landing experience. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, what better than a video in the background to explain the concept better and also tempting the user straight into the story.
    The "how it works" section follows the main part and, underneath, the pictures of the recipes reinforce the CTA. The last two sections highlight the social proof aspect, as knowing that other people are using the product or service can be very persuasive
    and reassuring, as well as establishing trust.
