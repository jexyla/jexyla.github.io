  <h2>The challenge</h2>

  <p>
    When I joined Gousto in the middle of 2014, the company was starting to experience rapid growth while the brand was struggling to keep up with the change. The current brand was not coveying the right message about the joy of cooking, so we felt the need to create a better brand that allowed us to show our core values.

  <h2>The approach</h2>
  <p>
    The Gousto name is a composition of the Italian word <strong>“gusto”</strong> (meaning flavor) and the foodie loving word <strong>“gourmet”</strong>. Since food is the heart of the business, the new logo should have been representing exactly that.</p>

  <p>All of the concepts were then focused on the cooking experience, which is meant to be enjoyable and fun. After sketching out various ideas, the final logo featured the Gousto <i>pot</i>, something that people are really familiar with. It has a humorous feel, reflects savouring and a cooking experience, hence reinforcing the good looks and warm vibes at every customer touch point. The use of red as our brand colour was chosen to represent fresh food, happiness and love.

  <h2>Iconography</h2>
  <p>
    The icons are based on handrawn drawings that support and enhance the playful and quirky aspects of Gousto’s personality. The choice of handrawn icons was to make the brand feeling more friendly and accessible, thus giving
    an immediately recognizable and unique style which competitors were lacking.

  <h2>Brand refresh</h2>
  <p>
    We created a comprehensive brand experience that differentiates itself from the competition with a humorous and quirky approach to all media, content and communications. We strived to offer our customer something new, interesting, stimulating or useful. Something to make them laugh, think or feel excited.

  <h2>Marketing</h2>
  <p>
    Since launching the new logo and brand identity, Gousto registered an increase in customers engagement which can be easily spotted on social media. From only 500 followers on Twitter, Gousto reached 10,000 in a few months, all thanks to the new quirky
    pakaging that resulted appealing to people for its warmth & personality; making them want to engage with the brand and share their experience via social media.

  <h2>Website</h2>
  <p>
    Altogether with the brand, came also a new landing page to create consistency within the user  experience. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, what better than a video in the background to explain the concept and also tempting the user straight into the story.</p>
    <p>The "how it works" section follows the main part and, underneath, the pictures of the recipes reinforce the CTA. The last two sections highlight the social proof aspect, as knowing that other people are using the product or service can be very persuasive
    and reassuring, as well as establishing trust.
