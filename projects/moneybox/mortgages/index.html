    <h2>Building Moneybox Mortgage Advice</h2>
    <p>
      At Moneybox, we’re on a mission to help everyone save and invest for their
      future. We’re already been helping hundreds of thousands of people in the
      Moneybox community to save for their first homes through our Lifetime ISA.
      Now, we’re excited to help on the next step of the journey, whether you’re
      buying your first home, next home or remortgaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February this year, we launched Moneybox Mortgage Advice — a full
      in-app service to help find a mortgage that’s right for you. Here, our
      design team takes you through how we built our new Mortgage In Principle
      in-app journey and brought to life our new mortgages service.

    <h2>The beginning…</h2>
    <p>
      When the Moneybox home-buying team first began to tackle the world of
      mortgages, we knew we wanted our customers to be able to complete their
      mortgage application from start to finish all from within the app. First
      up, the Mortgage In Principle (MIP), which is an official estimate from a
      mortgage lender confirming that, in principle, they would lend you a
      certain amount as a mortgage. We stripped this process down to the core
      questions that were legally required within a MIP, making the process a
      lot more digestible for the customer. We chose to show one question per
      screen and organised them into five meaningful sections: personal details,
      eligibility, income, outgoings, and mortgage details. To help make the
      process even smoother for our customers, we pre-populated some of the
      answers with information already known to us, like personal details.
    </p>

      />
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="text-left">
    <p>
      From a UI perspective, we made use of our input components in order to
      take advantage of elements we’ve previously designed and built. These were
      all part of our Design System.
    </p>

    <p>
      The form itself made use of micro-interactions to elevate progress
      throughout the application. It visually scrolls down as soon as the
      customer completes their answer, and has the previously answered question
      appearing at the top. Tapping on that section of the screen will lead you
      back to the appropriate question.
    </p>

      />
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="text-left">
    <p>
      To further highlight progress, we also introduced a progress bar right
      below the navigation to showcase percentage of completion. We worked
      really closely with developers in order to achieve the right balance
      between a user friendly UI and a seamless technical implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Good user experience doesn’t translate into visuals only. As designers, we
      look at the entire process, and this also extends to screen copy. At
      Moneybox, our tone of voice is simple, engaging and easy to understand, so
      we always opt for a friendly language. We also worked with our team of
      mortgage advisers to ensure the right terminology was used throughout the
      flow.

  <section class="text-left">
    <p>
      Finally, to make sure we were catering for our customer’s busy lives, we
      built a ‘save & exit’ functionality to allow for information to be
      completed at different points in time. This also helps if customer’s don’t
      have all of their information at hand at the time of starting a new MIP.

  <section class="text-left">

      At the end of the MIP journey, customers wait a few short seconds for
      their Mortgage In Principle details to be calculated and are entertained
      with a fun lottie animation, before being presented with their estimate
      certificate.

      The customer’s MIP application (or offer) can be accessed at any time
      in-app in the Accounts > Mortgages tab. After receiving and reviewing
      their MIP, they will have the option to choose between a phone call or an
      in-app chat with a Moneybox mortgage adviser. We believe that giving
      customers more than one option to choose from will help better accommodate
      their needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then track the customer’s journey through their mortgage application
      with updated copy at each milestone stage, keeping customers informed of
      their progress.

    <h2>Testing our assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      Ahead of any new service or app release, it’s important we test new in-app
      journeys with our beta customers to understand feedback and make any
      improvements necessary.

    <p>The objective for this beta testing was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a feel of how intuitive the questions were</li>
      <li>How lengthy the application perceived to be</li>
      <li>Understand if the progress bar was noticeable and helpful</li>

  </section>

  <section class="project-description text-left">
    <h2>What we learned</h2>
    <p>
      After reviewing the feedback received from users, we learned the
      following:
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>✅ The level of questions felt appropriate:</b> All participants were
      comfortable answering all the questions presented in the MIP.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>✅ It was quick and easy to apply:</b>

      All participants felt the application was very easy to complete and were
      positively surprised about how quick and easy the process was.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🆗Visual progress was good enough:</b> All participants noticed the
      progress bar at the top and felt it didn’t positively or negatively impact
      their application.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>✅ The level of questions felt appropriate:</b> All participants were
      comfortable answering all the questions presented in the MIP.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>❌ People were not familiar with MIP terminology:</b> All participants
      were not familiar with the “Mortgage in Principle” terminology and would
      prefer to get more information upfront.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>✅ The order of questions made sense:</b> All participants found the
      order of the sections logical.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🆚 People prefer chatting:</b> All participants expressed their
      preference in chatting vs. arranging a callback, mostly because they felt
      they could get an immediate reply.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>✅ People are comfortable applying in-app:</b> All participants were
      comfortable with starting a mortgage application from their mobile phone,
      especially if the application was well designed and only takes a few
      minutes to get started.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🤩 The UI felt friendly:</b> All participants praised the intuitive and
      clean interface and were delighted by the graphics.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🤔 The save and exit option wasn’t clear:</b> Participants didn’t
      understand that closing the application would save it. They were also
      expecting a back button on the top left corner and not an “X”.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b
        >✏️ People requested an easy way to make changes to their
        application:</b
      >
      All participants would expect to be able to edit each individual section
      rather than having to go through the whole application again.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>ℹ️ People would prefer helpful context in-place:</b> Even though
      participants said the questions were clear, there was a suggestion to
      explain further some of the questions, such as government schemes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-description text-left">
    <h2>Turning feedback into actions</h2>
    <p>
      We shared the results with the wider team and incorporated the feedback to
      improve the prototype even further:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We created different introduction screens with a better visual and an
        explanation of the process, including MIP terminology.
      </li>
      <li>
        We added extra content on the screens related to government schemes in
        order to offer education to people who are not familiar with the
        terminology, as well as a refresher for people who already know about
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even though we were already offering the ability to quit the journey and
        resume it. later on, based on the feedback we enhanced our approach and
        replaced the icon with the text “Save & Exit”.
      </li>
      <li>
        The beta testing sessions highlighted the importance of having the
        ability to review and edit all the answered questions, so we introduced
        a completely new screen to account for this.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve now rolled out Moneybox Mortgage Advice to all Moneybox customers
      and it’s been great to see so many people begin their mortgage journey

    </p>
    <p>
      Great design is the iteration of good design, and this is only possible
      through great collaboration from team members and feedback from our
      customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there is always room for iteration and improvement, we’re proud to
      have created a full in-app mortgage application experience that is
