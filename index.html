          About me
        </div>

        <p>
          Although I have a bachelor degree in <strong>Japanese üáØüáµ Language and Culture,</strong> I‚Äôve always been passionate about <strong>design</strong> and eventually managed to make a living out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like travelling a lot as I do believe that visiting different places and learning about new cultures can truly open your vision. Infact, I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have experienced life in some awesome places. Born in the <strong>US</strong> and
          raised in sunny <strong>Italy</strong>, I‚Äôve been living in <strong>Japan</strong> for 3 months, over one year in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>, 5 months in <strong>Germany</strong> and I‚Äôm currently based in <strong>London</strong> where I work as a Product Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/@jexyla">@carwow</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When it comes to design, the most important thing to know about is that it involves other people.</strong> Great products can‚Äôt happen because of just one single person‚Äôs contribution. They are instead the result of collaboration between different roles within a company. I‚Äôve written quite a few <a href="https://medium.muz.li/should-designers-code-or-should-developers-design-23e480c6700a">articles</a> on the topic, especially about devs ‚ù§ designers collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm also a hardcore <strong>Design Systems</strong> advocate and contributed both code-wise and design-wise to the carwow live styleguide.
