    Although I have a bachelor degree in <strong>Japanese Language and Culture</strong>, Iâ€™ve always been passionate about design and eventually managed to make a living out of it. Check out some of my work here ðŸ‘‡ or read my thoughts about design on <a href="https://medium.com/@jexyla">Medium</a>.

          While Gousto was experiencing growth quickly, the brand was struggling to keep up with the change and we felt like a re-branding was very much needed.

    I like travelling a lot as I do believe that visiting different places and learning about new cultures can truly open your vision. Infact, Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to have experienced life in some awesome places. Born in the <strong>US</strong> and
    raised in sunny <strong>Italy</strong>, Iâ€™ve been living in <strong>Japan</strong> for 3 months, over one year in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>, 5 months in <strong>Germany</strong> and Iâ€™m currently based in <strong>London</strong>.

    When I'm not in front of my colorful macbook full of quarky stickers, I like singing, drawing doodles and binge watching tons of TV series on Netflix.
