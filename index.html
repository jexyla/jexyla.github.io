        Although I have a bachelor degree in <strong>Japanese Language and Culture</strong>, I’ve always been passionate about design and eventually managed to make a living out of it. You can check out some of my pixels on <a href="https://www.dribbble.com/jexyla">Dribbble</a> and written thoughts on <a href="https://medium.com/@jexyla">Medium</a>.

        I like travelling a lot as I do believe that visiting different places and learning about new cultures can truly open your vision. Infact, I’ve been lucky enough to have experienced life in some awesome places. Born in the <strong>US</strong> and raised in sunny <strong>Italy</strong>, I’ve been living in <strong>Japan</strong> for 3 months, over one year in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>, 5 months in <strong>Germany</strong> and I’m currently based in <strong>London</strong>.

        When I'm not in front of my colorful macbook full of quarky stickers, I like singing, drawing doodles and binge watching tons of TV series on Netflix.
